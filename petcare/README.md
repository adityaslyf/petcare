Open any of the HTML files in a web browser to view the wireframes. The CSS styles are contained in the `css/styles.css` file, and the interactivity is powered by `js/script.js`.

## Notes

- These are enhanced wireframes that provide both visual design and interactive functionality
- All placeholder elements (like [Optimized Image], [Admin Alert], etc.) would be replaced with actual content in the final implementation
- The design incorporates best practices from real-world veterinary and pet care websites
- Animations and transitions make the wireframes more engaging for client presentations
