## Notes

- These are low-fidelity wireframes intended for initial design review
- Grayscale design allows focus on structure rather than aesthetics
- All placeholder elements (like [Optimized Image], [Admin Alert], etc.) would be replaced with actual content in the final implementation
- The design incorporates best practices from real-world veterinary and pet care websites
